# spotdesirability

## Python implementation of desirability functions for multivariate optimisation

`spotdesirability` implements the Derringer & Suich (1980) desirability framework, providing a flexible set of tools for multi-objective optimization through desirability functions.

*   **Documentation**: See the [Hyperparameter Tuning Cookbook](cookbook.qmd) for a guide on using desirability functions with scikit-learn, PyTorch, and more.
*   **API Reference**: Detailed documentation of all classes and functions can be found in the [Reference](reference/index.qmd) section.
