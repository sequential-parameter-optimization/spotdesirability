# spotdesirability

* `Python` implementation of the `R` package `desirability`, which provides  S3 classes for multivariate optimization using the desirability function by Derringer and Suich (1980).

# Installation

* Installation can be done with `pip`: 

```{bash}
pip install spotdesirability
```

* Alternatively, you can clone the repository and install it manually.
